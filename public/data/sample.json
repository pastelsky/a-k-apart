Cook is aware that the Dutch explorer, Tasman, had sighted New Zealand some 100 years before, but was seen off by Maori and did not land. Cook charts the entire coastline of the country Tasman had seen, and discovers it is two large islands. He is also aware that there is land to the west, whose western, and in part southern and northern shores had been found by the Dutch but whose eastern seaboard was entirely unkown. Leaving New Zealand on roughly the same latitude as the known land had been plotted, Cook sails westwards"
